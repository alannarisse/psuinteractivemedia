					<p>Today, the CineMagic is a neighborhood theater that keeps it cheap and simple. We play movies, serve the
						best popcorn in town, and pour from a constantly changing taplist of great beer. We don’t serve food, but if
						you buy a pint, we’ll turn a blind eye to that badly hidden slice of pizza. </p>

					<h3>The Theater</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The CineMagic is a single screen movie theater that originally opened in 1914 as the Palm, making it one of
						the oldest theaters on the west coast.<p>In the last 100 years the theater has taken many names, including
							the Hawthorne (1915), the Star Hawethorne (1934), the Zephyr (1937), the Plaza (1938), the Fine Arts
							(1957), and the Columbia (1987).</p>
						<p>In 1991, current owner Chuck Nakvasil purchased the theater, and renovated it as the CineMagic.</p>
