            <h3>Hello Beautiful People!</h3>
            <p>It is currently March 9th. 2022 as I type this. The Spring term for PSU is right around the corner. If you've taken my DES341 course -- Interactive Media I, I have lots of space in my two spring sections for Interactiv e Media II, aka DES342. Please join us! The time slots are...</p>
            <p>
              Tues and Thurs 9 - 11:50am<br />
              Tues and Thurs 3 - 5:50pm
            </p>
            <p>DES342 is a continuation of DES341. We'll be playig with website design and code and making some really fun stuff.</p>
            <p>There are a couple of prerequisites for this course. However, if you have some experience with html and css, let's talk! I can waive prerequisites if it seems like you can keep up just fine. In Interactive Media I, most students have no coding experience, and they learn how to add some css animations, a sprinkling of javascript, and they create multi-column layouts.</p>
