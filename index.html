            <h3>Hello Beautiful People!</h3>

            <h4>Welcome to Spring 2025</h4>
            <p><strong>This website has additional resources for DES 341, Interactive Media I, DES342 Interactive Media II, DES340, DES140, and DES111</strong></p>

            <p>This term I am teaching DES 342 and DES340</p>
            <p>I made a <a href="/resources/flowchart-chart.html">chart of flow chart symbols</a> and their meanings. There's also a Figjam version:</p>
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/board/HYT1I6UBdQuf2QCVCCKwXC/Flow-Chart-Symbols-and-their-meanings?node-id=0-1&t=y3RMIz7LfTNz0WJn-1" target="_blank"><img src="resources/images/flowchart/flowchart-chart-figjam.png" style="width:600px;"></a>
            <h4>A Bit About Me</h4>
            <p>I'm a Silicon Valley kid, born and raised in San Jose California. I worked at a bunch of large tech companies, design agencies, and start-ups before moving to Portland in 2009 to start a family. I have a 14 year old daughter in High School and two cute but needy dogs. My background is a mix of art, engineering, and design and I’ve always loved to think about how things are made, both digitally and in the “flesh.” I care deeply about user experience design and accessibility. I had a non-traditional education background, I got my bachelors when I was 38 and my masters when I was 45. I’m neurospicy and I love to incorporate multiple learning styles into my classes. This is my very first time teaching this class. I have taught Interactive Media (DES 341 and DES 342) and Interaction Design Principles (DES 340) as well as Foundations in Motion, UX, UI (DES 140). I've been an adjunct at PSU for about 6 years. </p>

           

           <p>If you want to get a jump start on the class here are some things you'll need:</p>
