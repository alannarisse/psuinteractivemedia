            <p>“The Room of Silence,” is a short documentary about race, identity and marginalization at the Rhode Island School of Design. Based on interviews conducted by myself and the campus organization Black Artists and Designers, this film contains well under a third of the stories we collected in March 2016, and an unknown fraction of the stories belonging to students we didn’t have a chance to meet with.</p>

          <li><strong>Javascript:</strong> A scripting language that, among many other things, lets us manipulate an html page on the fly. Javascript and Java are Completely different languages.</li>
          <li><strong>Repo or repository:</strong> Git and github refer to projects as "repos" or "repositories." They are basically folders where all of the files reside. You can't have repositories inside of other repositories.</li>
          <li><strong>JQuery:</strong> A library written in Javascript that makes manipulating html and css in a broswer easier than writing it in plain "vanilla" javascript.</li>
