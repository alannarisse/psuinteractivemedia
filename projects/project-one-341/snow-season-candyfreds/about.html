		<div><p> Snowboarding has been around since 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, created an invention for his daughter that consisted of strapping two skis together and adding a rope to the end in order to have control going down the mountain. This contrapstion was quickly named the “Snurfer” and established the journey of many more snowboards to come. Different skill levels, styles, and preferences have gone into the making of modern snowboards to create the perfect ride for all types of riders. 

		Throughout the years, the shape and size of these boards have changed in order to alter the riding style for individuals boarding in all different types of terrain including: powder, mountain, park, and backcountry. This website will be looking at the similarities, differences, and uses for these different types of boards to give the public a better understanding of what board will be perfect for them and their style. </p></div>

				<li>Grassroots Powdersurfing was founded to create a pure, and truly binding-free powder-riding experience. Drawing inspiration from skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding, we developed a form of self-expression that pays tribute to the heart and soul of snowboarding.</li>
				<li>Freestyle snowboarding is a winter sport in which athletes perform various on-air and ground tricks while riding a snowboard. It is the most popular style of snowboarding as it provides athletes with the most challenge and thrill. The primary objective of the sport is to perform various types of jumps, rail slides, tricks, rides on half-pipes, and switch riding. Freestyle snowboarding is currently practiced and contested by both men and women.</li>
				<li>A spiltboard is a snowboard that has been cut in half vertically to make two “skis.” With these skis, you can hike up into the backcountry using climbing skins, think of a more evolved snowshoe. Once you have reached your desired peak, attach the skis back together and you’ve got a board to shred down a pristine (and hopefully powder filled) run. Splitboarding is the snowboarder’s key to accessing backcountry terrain.</li>
