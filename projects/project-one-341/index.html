        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <h4>::PROJECT OBJECTIVES::</h4>
        <p>There is a saying in web design: “Content is king.” Above all else, people use the web to get information. In fact, the original purpose of HTML wasn’t to make beautiful, artistic web pages, or to make super cool apps, but simply to organize and structure content. To this end, our job as designers is to create a system that can present our content in the best and most usable way possible.</p>
        <p>Our first project is a 5-page mini site—one homepage and four details pages—that will showcase a small set of items that are interesting or personally relevant to the student. This site should highlight the similarities between the various items, visually and informationally, while allowing each item to retain its individual characteristics and values. At the same time, the site should maintain a cohesive visual language that encompasses and emphasizes the set as a whole.</p>

        <h4>RESEARCH/PROCESS</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Thorough look at how other designers are tackling hierarchical pieces of informationlike this. It doesn’t have to be exactly the same sort of site as what you want to do,but keep your eyes open for some inspiration.</li>
          <li>Divergent research process that considers various user experiences, navigationformats and aesthetic approaches to the problem (at least three directions of each).</li>
          <li>Complete UI workflow (content analysis, wire frames, mood boards, design comps)</li>
        </ul>
