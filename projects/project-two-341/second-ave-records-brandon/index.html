Coming from Los Angelas California, Fidlar proposes the noise into the alternative stream of music with loud low end guitar and bass, thrashy-drums, shades on the face, and a middle finger in the air. Over the Years, Fidlar has grown to have a major fanbase, with likes ranging from soft alternative, to loud surf punk and thrash going back to the eighties. Before listening, throw away your cares and get ready for lots of high energetic fun with an angsty-twist.</p>

This band has been working hard since 2007 to carry the torch handed down from those such as Phobia, and Napalm Death. This album starts with a huge wall of distortion carried by chainsaw-driven guitars and one of the fastest drum rolls you can think of. The first track is an introduction to an album full of blast beats, throat shredding growls and squeals, eerie dissonance, and full blown hellish power.</p>

Deafheaven has been compared to the black-metal gods and to the alternative contemporaries. From one drastic end to the other, Deafheaven is distinctive in the best way possible, making such an aggressive and terrifying sound siuch as Black and Death Metal sound delicate and harmonious.</p>
