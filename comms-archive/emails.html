    <h2>Second Email</h2>
    <p>Hello! How are things going?</p>

<p>In this email:</p>
      <p>- Help! Images are broken on github.com<br>
      - Help! Where do I submit my design journal entry for the week?<br>
      - Where's that Wired25 assignment you promised us?</p>

<p>There are two popular questions I'm getting, so here are the answers to those:</p>

<p>Problem: Images work fine locally in my homework but they don't work on github.com</p>

<p>Solution! You probably have one of two issues. The most popular issue is that you are using a mix of lowercase and uppercase folders and filenames. For instance, maybe you named your folder "Images" but in html you are using "images." this will work locally, but not on the server! Find out more here in this handy video! https://youtu.be/ftWedsSSC-s And the second most popular image problem is also later on in the video. </p>

<p>Problem: I don't know where to submit my design journal entry for this week. 
Solution: If you have already posted a link to your homework 1, and you committed and pushed your design journal changes to github.com, you are done! I already have your design journal link. If you haven't been able to finish the homework 1 assignment, just email me your github username please!</p>

<p>Wired25 conference! There's a homework for that! If you are interested in earning 5 points, go read more! https://3.basecamp.com/3840950/buckets/18702888/vaults/3080879656</p>

<p>LOTS more videos are getting added to the video page on the class Basecamp. But I'm still organizing them. So just focus on the duckett book, the design journal, and homework 1 for now.</p>

<p>Cool! See you Monday.</p>

    <h2>Welcome Email 9/23/20</h2>
    <p>Hello DES 341 Fall 2020 students! I’m your instructor for the course and I’m really excited to get this ball rolling. I've made a welcome video for you all. It's not super chock full of info but it gives you a bit of an idea of what we'll be up to in Interactive Media this term and let's you see my face! My Welcome video: https://youtu.be/rDpcT2PfcJk Things to know: Zoom We'll be meeting twice a week as a group in Zoom to do group work. Those meetings will happen in the beginning of your class time. So 9-10:30ishMW for the morning session, 12-1:30ish for afternoon session. You are required-sh (see attendance policy below*) to attend these sessions and there will be other online work like one-on-ones with me and group work session. So expect 6 active hours of work a week. and expect another 4-6 in homework per week. Basecamp We'll use Basecamp for our "Home Base." Don't worry if you haven't used it before. It's pretty easy to find your way around and I'll make sure I do demos. Look for an invite, probably over the weekend, maybe today if I get my act together. Software We'll use the following software in class: Visual Studio Code(https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for writing code and previewing our work, and Github Desktop(https://desktop.github.com/) to publish our work to the web. I am so, so, so bummed that Adobe Creative Suite is no longer free for students. We'll be using Figma for design(https://www.figma.com/) and it's free, so don't worry if you can't afford ACS. Yes, you can install this software now if you like, but you don’t have to. For github Desktop you'll need to create an account on https://github.com/. Slack The school of A+D set up a slack channel for you all to keep connected. I really encourage you to use it. There are tons of fun channels getting going like pets, upcoming events, students with kids, students with jobs. Please introduce yourselves in the introductions channel! We have an interactive media channel so you can chat with other students in interactive media. FAQs - Hey teach, I've got a wacky work schedule, if I'm in the morning class (9-10:30ish), can I attend the afternoon class(12-1:30ish) occassionally? YES! Just communicate with me ahead of time. - Will I be able to track my grade? YES! I'll have a spreadsheet for each of you where - I'll try my best to keep your current points up to date. What other burning questions do you have? Email me: arisse@pdx.edu New to Zoom? If you are new to Zoom, Sean Schumacher made this great slide deck all about Zoom to get you oriented and set up: https://psu.gd/wp-content/uploads/Zoomies-for-students-sm.pdf *Attendance Policy The attendance policy for the GD Program is a flexible policy for this term, due to COVID-19 and remote learning. Your health and safety are priority #1. Though we do expect you to complete the course requirements and show up as much as you can. Getting behind can snowball, so please reach out to me as soon as you think you might need to miss class, so we can put a good plan in place to keep you on track. PSU Coronavirus response https://www.pdx.edu/coronavirus-response I'm here to help you have a super fun time in this class, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me on email arisse@pdx.edu or ping me in basecamp when I get you all added in. Oh! A final note. Tomorrow I’m literally retreating to a cabin in the woods with no internet so I can get a whole lot of videos recorded, so don’t fret if I don’t reply right away. I’m back on Saturday. See you next week!!!!! -Alanna ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Alanna Risse (she/her) PSU School of Art + Design Adjunct Instructor Design 341- Interactive Media I https://des341.com/ arisse@pdx.edu ~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
